# client_server
Very very basic client and server in c++

In the linux terminal type "make", and then ./server to run the server and ./client to run the client
and then if you want to delete the .o files, "make clean" will do that.
After any changes are made to client.cpp or server.cpp, simply call "make" again and it will rebuild the necessary components.
